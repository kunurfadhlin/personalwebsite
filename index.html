<h1>Welcome to Story of My life! ‚ú®</h1>
        <p1><b>Bismillah & Assalamualaikum. Hello everyone welcome to story of my life. Speaking of it, my name is Ku Nurfadhlin Bt Ku Amirudin & currently struggling for my last semester in UiTM Kedah. <br>
Just me, myself and I, exploring the universe of uknownment. I have a heart of love and a interest of journey throughout my entire life and here, I want to share my world with you. </b></p1>

    <p2><i>‚ÄúYour journey should be a mixture of two things: Observation and seizing your chance. You have to be aware of all that's happening around you and never disregard something as pure hazard. Listen to and observe all that happens until you receive the sign you need to continue your journey. As soon as you receive that information, seize if and continue your way.‚Äù
